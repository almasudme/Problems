#Combinatoric selection
Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation (5c3) =10, 
nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!) where 
r<=n n!=nx(n-1)x(n-2) .... 3x2x1



It is not until , that a value exceeds one-million: 
.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of nCr for 1<=n<=r
 for , are greater than one-million?
