Problem : you have to categorize the dataset provided in the sample.txt. There are 6 columns in this dataset.  Note that the columns are not of same width and the data in each row are separated by space " ". 
DECK  is name of a test. If this test passes The RESULT Column should have an entry called "BLESS".The Comment column is empty. If this test failed there will be comment. You have to categorize all the tests in ters of this comments.

This comment has Keywords associated with some value.  For example 40101neg has Identifier USEWAR122 and the value associated with it is 238/265. Dont bother about the values. Create a list of testcases associated with each keyword. Ignore any single letter keyword. Create a table summarizing all 1000 tests based on this keywords.
If you solve the problem for the first 10 tests in this file. The column would look like this


Keyword 	Number of failures 	Deck Names
======= 	==================	===========
COMDISVEC 2			              aabssm1,aabssm1x
40101neg  1			              40101neg
